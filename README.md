## Web Scraper project

**The basic concept of this project:****
It will be a simple web scraper which will show us the scraped data  in a table based on the user given link and tag .

so, we have
 - one link field in form
 - one tag filed in the form
 - 
 **I have added some extra:**
 I made one form for only using tag and another one is to use tag with attributes like (src,href, style etc.)

**Output:**
A table which contains **TAG** name, **Attribute** name and **Result** with the **web address** user gave in the form.
